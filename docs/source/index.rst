morse
=================================

γ Doradus (γ Dor) and slowly-pulsating B-type (SPB) stars are main-sequence
stars that pulsate in low-frequency gravito-inertial modes. The morse package is
dedicated to the seismic analysis of these two classes of pulsating stars. It
allows you to:

* find gravity-mode period spacing patterns,
* perform mode identification,
* measure the mean internal rotation rate,
* measure the buoyancy radius of the resonant cavity,

using the list of frequencies extracted from the oscillation spectrum.
